\description{
A dataset mapping the difficulty of access to healthcare services, both
physically and due to the risk of digital exclusion, across Data Zones in
Scotland - labelled LSOA's in this package for consistency with other nations
}
\details{
The DEPAHRI Index is building on the \figure{https://github.com/GreaterManchesterODA/Digital-Exclusion-Risk-Index/tree/main},
an index of risk of digital exclusion across England, Wales and Scotland.
Different DERI scores are calculated using the minimum and maximum values of
indicators at different geographical levels. The DEPAHRI Index is calculated
using national minimum and maximum values, so it uses DERI scores at the
national level.
